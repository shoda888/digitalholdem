NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Module build failed: ReferenceError: [BABEL] /Users/shoda/digitalholdem/app/javascript/app.vue: Unknown option: base.omit. Check out http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/ for more information about options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Invalid:
  `{ presets: [{option: value}] }`
Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

For more detailed information on preset configuration, please see http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#pluginpresets-options.

Module build failed: ReferenceError: [BABEL] /Users/shoda/digitalholdem/app/javascript/app.vue: Unknown option: base.omit. Check out http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/ for more information about options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Invalid:
  `{ presets: [{option: value}] }`
Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

For more detailed information on preset configuration, please see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#pluginpresets-options.

Module build failed: ReferenceError: [BABEL] /Users/shoda/digitalholdem/app/javascript/app.vue: Unknown option: base.omit. Check out http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/ for more information about options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Invalid:
  `{ presets: [{option: value}] }`
Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

For more detailed information on preset configuration, please see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#pluginpresets-options.

Module build failed: ReferenceError: [BABEL] /Users/shoda/digitalholdem/app/javascript/app.vue: Unknown option: base.omit. Check out http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/ for more information about options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Invalid:
  `{ presets: [{option: value}] }`
Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

For more detailed information on preset configuration, please see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#pluginpresets-options.

Module build failed: ReferenceError: [BABEL] /Users/shoda/digitalholdem/app/javascript/app.vue: Unknown option: base.omit. Check out http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/ for more information about options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Invalid:
  `{ presets: [{option: value}] }`
Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

For more detailed information on preset configuration, please see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#pluginpresets-options.

A common cause of this error is the presence of a configuration options object without the corresponding preset name. Example:

Valid:
  `{ presets: [['presetName', {option: value}]] }`

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
